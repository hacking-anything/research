Application: Cisco IOS, Cisco IOS-XE
Vendor: Cisco [a link](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180328-smi2)
Bugs: Stack-based buffer overflow [CWE-20], [CWE-121]
Risk: Critical; AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C (10.0)


Summary
A vulnerability in the Smart Install feature of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger a reload 
of an affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition, or to execute arbitrary code on an affected device.

The vulnerability is due to improper validation of packet data. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted Smart Install message to an 
affected device on TCP port 4786. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a buffer overflow on the affected device, which could have the 
following impacts:
Triggering a reload of the device
Allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the device
Causing an indefinite loop on the affected device that triggers a watchdog crash
Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
